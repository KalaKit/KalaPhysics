*Elypso Physics* is a lightweight C++ 20 physics library utilizing GLM for core mathematical operations while maintaining compatibility with any graphics API, not just OpenGL.

*Elypso Physics* is **OS-agnostic** and should be fully compatible with **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**, though it remains **untested on macOS** and **non-Unix-based Linux distributions**. It uses only standard **C++ 20** libraries and **GLM** for mathematical operations, ensuring cross-platform support.

*Elypso Physics* is in VERY early development, is currently unstable, and will undergo significant changes. Basic AABB collision detection is functional.

Full documentation for *Elypso Physics* will be available on the [official website](https://www.elypsoengine.com) in the near future. Please refer there for installation and usage instructions, as this README does not cover those details.
