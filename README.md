This is a lightweight C++ 20 physics library for Windows and Linux utilizing GLM for core mathematical operations while maintaining compatibility with any graphics API, not just OpenGL.

*Elypso Physics* is in VERY early development, is currently unstable, and will undergo significant changes. Basic AABB collision detection is functional.

Full documentation for *Elypso Physics* will be available on the [website](https://www.elypsoengine.com) in the near future. Please refer there for installation and usage instructions, as this README does not cover those details.
